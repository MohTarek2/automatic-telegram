                <h2>Why Kids Should Learn coding?</h2>
            <p>Students who learn to code are motivated to break down complex problems into smaller issues. Learning how to code, provides children with a basic understanding of algorithmic thinking patterns, from a very tender age. And this eventually gets translated into mathematical pursuits, helping them in improving their computational skills
                
                
                Research report by a team of UC Berkeley psychologists recommends that creativity tends to reduce as we age. Question remains, how do we preserve a childâ€™s creative skills as they age then? This is exactly why should kids learn to code. More and more practice leads to not only a creative mindset but also an experimental discipline
                
                In a programming context, kids being coders are continuously challenged and asked to problem-solve. And the more they practice, the more they get an opportunity to hone their skills. They receive the problem, break down the same into sub-problems, and proceed with an iterative process of finding out solutions.

                <P>
                    Coding is a process of writing instructions for creating computer software, websites, and apps. Surprisingly, kindergarteners can understand basic coding concepts and can develop skills that come in hand

                            <p>Coding for kids refers to the opportunities available for children to get involved in coding. These opportunities aim to be fun and gamified to keep kids' young minds engaged. You might also hear coding referred to as "programming," or "computer programming."

                    Computer-free activities such as this 'Little Red Hen Unplugged Coding Activity' will help students to think about giving instructions in the form of directions on a grid. These activity sheets, best suited to students in Years 1-4, allow them to think about how to get from one place to another, using the language forward, backward, turn left and turn right.
